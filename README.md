## ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction Web App

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the risk of heart disease using user input such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc. The app is built with **Streamlit** and uses a **logistic regression model** trained on the **UCI Heart Disease dataset**.

### ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

* **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
* **Scikit-learn** (Logistic Regression, preprocessing pipeline)
* **Streamlit** (for interactive web interface)

### ðŸ“Š Features

* Real-time prediction based on user input
* Clean and responsive web UI
* Trained using real-world medical data
* Easily extendable with other models (Random Forest, SVM, etc.)

### ðŸ—‚ Files Included

* `app.py` â€“ Streamlit code
* `heart.csv` â€“ Dataset
* `logistic_regression_model.pkl` â€“ Trained model
* `preprocessing_pipeline.pkl` â€“ Data preprocessing pipeline
* `requirements.txt` â€“ Python dependencies

### ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Clone the repository
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git`

2. Install requirements
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the app
